		    	<p class="information">This app was created to assist in the administrative tasks that make the science competitions run so smoothly. It will be used by the administrators to view volunteers and whether they have checked in/out yet, send assignment updates directly to a volunteer, and push important notifications to event staffers. The volunteers will use this app to check in, see their assignment, and check out.</p>
