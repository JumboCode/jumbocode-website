							<p>In order to offer high quality service, we assemble specialized teams of programmers, designers and entrepreneurs to work on projects until completion. Each team is assigned a Project Lead, who is in charge of planning, team management, and client communication. We use agile methodologies to ensure great service.</p>
							<p>The Executive Board is responsible for overseeing general club operation, as well as managing clients and teams. As a new organization, we continue to learn, grow, and adapt. We hope to become the premier digital consulting organization in the Greater Boston area.</p>
