				    	<p class="info">The Tufts Daily is the student-run, financially
                independent paper of Tufts University. Running peices of
                traditional news, arts, and sports, the Daily covers not only
                the integral aspects of campus life, but also of the surrounding
                Medford and Somerville communities.</p>

				    	<p class="info"> The organization not only publishes in print
                daily, but also maintains a website devoted to its content.
                Wanting to build off their current online presence, JumboCode
                developed an app for the paper so mobile users can acess content
                in a user-friendly way.</p>
