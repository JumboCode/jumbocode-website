             <p class="info"> Boston Harbor Islands is Boston’s own national
               park. The islands are administered by the National Park Service,
               and are a popular tourist attraction in Boston.

             <h1>The Project</h1>
             <p class="info"> To access these islands, visitors must take one
                 of the ferries which run on a seasonal schedule. The ferry
                 schedule was recently integrated into Google maps but is yet to
                 be incorporated into their website. Boston Harbor Islands
                 currently has charts on the website that simply list the times
                 of each ferry. JumboCode is going to build an application that
                 will present the ferry schedule in a clear and useful manner.
                 It will track where each ferry is, when the next ferry will be
                 and which island it is going to. It will also update the chart
                 of times depending on the season. A variant of the application
                 will also be deployed on kiosks around the islands. </p>
