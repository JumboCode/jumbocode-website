				    	<p class="info">The Boston Athletic Association is a non-profit
                organization with a mission of promoting a healthy lifestyle
                through sports, especially running. Although mostly known for
                hosting the Boston Marathon, B.A.A puts on several events per
                year and actively supports running programs throughout the
                greater Boston area.</p>

				    	<h1>The Project</h1>
				    	<p class="info">For a race as big as the Boston Marathon, managing
                 the thousands of volunteers who help run the event is a daunting
                 task. Typically done on paper, Jumbocode built a mobile
                 application for B.A.A. to help expedite the volunteer check-in
                 process.</p>
