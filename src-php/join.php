        <p>Unfortunately, the current JumboCode season has already begun, and at this point we are no longer looking to accept any more team members.</p>

        <p>But we are always excited about the next round of projects, and would love to have your support soon, regardless of your skill level. Please like us on Facebook and keep an eye out for our next GIM - that's when we'll be announcing the upcoming projects and recruiting new team members.</p>

        <p>If you have any other questions, please reach out to us through email at: </br> info [at] jumbocode [dot] org</p>
