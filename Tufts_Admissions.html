		    	<p class="information">The Tufts Admissions Department is responsible for building each successive class of students at Tufts. The recent steep increase in the number of applications to Tufts has resulted in an acceptance rate thatâ€™s been steadily falling over the past few years. Tufts Admissions uses a number of methods to attract students to apply to the University, some examples of which include school visits, tours of campus, on-campus events, and a plethora of online content. </p>

		    	<p class="information">The app will allow prospective students to easily navigate the Jumbo Days event. It will show families where they need to go on a map containing current events, contain a list of coupons to local spots where families can experience the Tufts community, and even push notifications to devices in case there is an important update that families will need.
