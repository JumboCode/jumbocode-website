              <br> The Boston Athletic Association is a non-profit organization with a mission of promoting a healthy lifestyle through sports, especially running. Although mostly known for hosting the Boston Marathon, B.A.A puts on several events per year and actively supports running programs throughout the greater Boston area.

              <br>
              <strong>The project</strong>
              <br> For a race as big as the Boston Marathon, managing the thousands of volunteers who help run the event is a daunting task. Typically done on paper, Jumbocode is building a mobile application for B.A.A to help expedite the volunteer checkin process <br>

              <strong>About this organization</strong>
              <br> WMFO 91.5 is Tufts University’s student and community operated freeform radio station. Broadcasting out of Curtis Hall, WMFO programming can be heard across the campus and throughout the greater Boston area. The station is managed by an elected board of student DJs, and is maintained by a larger group of student and community volunteers. It broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year from the Tufts University Medford/Somerville Campus.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>The project</strong>
              <br> Maintaining a fully functional radio station is a difficult task. Currently the station relies on a series of different portals and forms to deal with important things like program scheduling and volunteer hours. Wanting to centralize these functions, Jumbocode is building a cohesive, central portal to streamline the station's logistical needs.

              <strong>The project</strong>
              <br> The agency maintains information about each adult including an emergency fact sheet, and ID sheet and a government mandated healthcare record. The current system is sloppy and inaccurate, and while there are other systems they could purchase, they are too costly for Walnut Street Center. It will have a user friendly interface so that the home managers, directors and program coordinators can easily access and update the information. It will also serve as a database to store all of the information about each adult.

              <strong>About this organization</strong>
              <br> Boston Harbor Islands is Boston’s own national park. The islands are administered by 
                   the National Park Service, and are a popular tourist attraction in Boston. 
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>The project</strong>
              <br> To access these islands, visitors must take one of the ferries which run on a seasonal schedule. The ferry schedule was recently integrated into Google maps but is yet to be incorporated into their website. Boston Harbor Islands currently has charts on the website that simply list the times of each ferry. JumboCode is going to build an application that will present the ferry schedule in a clear and useful manner. It will track where each ferry is, when the next ferry will be and which island it is going to. It will also update the chart of times depending on the season. A variant of the application will also be deployed on kiosks around the islands.

              <br> The Peace Corps is a volunteer-driven federal organization. Peace Corps volunteers work in developing areas around the world in fields such as education, public health, agriculture and IT. In addition to helping those in need, the Peace Corps encourages cultural exchange and aims to foster world peace through greater cultural understanding.

              <strong>The project</strong>
              <br> When it comes to food and nutrition, Peace Corps volunteers living in rural areas all over the globe must be creative given local resources and limited equipment. The Peace Corps innovation team has been collecting recipes from volunteers stationed all over the world. We are working with the Peace Corps to turn all the wonderful recipe data into something meaningful, first by streamlining the data from word documents and PDF's into a structured database, then by building a modern mobile platform for volunteers all over the world to browse recipies, as well as add their own!
