		    	<p class="information">STOMP works to operate weekly workshops in their partner school. To do this, many of the workshops require a variable selection of resources that must be brought to and from STOMP. This app allows STOMP volunteers to log and track available resources as well as request new materials that may not be available. It also has a calendar to conveniently display upcoming STOMP events.</p>
